# Selective-Connectivity-2022

 Codes used in simulations analyzed for paper "Selective connectivity enhances storage capacity in attractor models of memory function".
 The codes provided can be use to replicate all the results shown in the paper. Because of storage limits, most of the raw results of simulations
 could not be included. Further raw data (such as the resulting connectivity matrices of optimized networks via simulated annealing) can
 be found in the provided link: https://osf.io/yr93w/ (you may need to create a free account)
