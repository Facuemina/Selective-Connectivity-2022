# Selective-Connectivity-2022

 Codes used in simulations analyzed for paper "Selective connectivity enhances storage capacity in attractor models of memory function".
 The codes provided can be used to replicate all the results shown in the paper. Because of storage limits, most of the raw results of 
 simulations could not be included in this repository. Further raw data (such as the resulting connectivity matrices of optimized networks 
 via simulated annealing) can be found in the provided link: https://osf.io/yr93w/ (you may need to create a free account).
